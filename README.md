Current Students jGCal
======================

A jQuery plugin that hits the Google Calendar API for public feeds, makes
pretty thumbnails out of them and calls $.slideDown to bring all the boys to
the yard. I swear, back when I made this, that shit was all the rage.

In all honesty this is only half a repo. I can't find all the shiny CSS that
made this thing look good and the page that it was on
(<http://www.umd.umich.edu/currentstudents>) has been replaced with a slightly
less exciting sitemap.

**So basically do whatever you want with this code**. There are a few good
nuggets, but most of this is old news. Cheers.
